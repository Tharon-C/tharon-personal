title: Hello and Thanks
---
Thank you for taking interest. I'm a software engineer working mostly in front end development, and specializing in design systems, theming and component libraries.

I work mostly in React but have an interest in Elm, ReasonML and native web components. I am in the CSS in JS camp but only recommend this to others if a) they enjoy working that way or b) are in a large enough code base where the nature of CSS starts to be a problem. I'm not dogmatic about anything though so I can see trade offs either way and in the end take the stance of "it simply depends on your situation".

When I'm not working, I am usually either spending time with my family (I have a wife and two kids) or playing music, and sometimes both at the same time.
