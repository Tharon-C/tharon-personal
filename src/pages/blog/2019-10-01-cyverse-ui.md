At CyVerse on the Atmosphere team, we were struggling with the typical problems that come with a large code base. We had legacy code to maintain and new features to implement into an existing system. There were consistency issues and unhealthy CSS, and the UX was suffering as evident by the support tickets we were getting.

## No Designer

Since we had no formal designer role we wanted a way to steer design systematically. I would assume role of designer part time for new features and establish design patterns that could be followed by other developers to be broadly applied to existing features as a first pass. This would allow us to move quickly to improve the app more holistically or generally without adding to the problem and then back fill with more intentional design starting with major offenders first.
